# Research Manifesto — Modern Alchemy

This research proceeds from the principle that intelligence transformation is not merely a technological development but a civilizational transition.

The study of artificial intelligence must address:

- transformation of human cognition
- structural economic change
- limits of human authority
- moral consequence of creation

The objective is not prediction, but understanding.

Truth over comfort.  
Understanding over optimism.  
Inquiry without assumption.

All transformation carries cost.
