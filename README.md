# AI Research — Modern Alchemy
### Spencer Kitaro Cottrell · San José State University

This repository contains a research program investigating artificial intelligence as a transformational force across cognition, economic systems, and human governance.

The work explores how increasingly autonomous intelligence reshapes human institutions and long-term civilizational structure.

## Research Program — Modern Alchemy (2026)

This research series studies the emergence of autonomous intelligence across three levels:

1. **Intelligence** — how learning systems become autonomous agents  
2. **Economics** — how society reorganizes around machine intelligence  
3. **Control** — limits of human governance over advanced systems  

Together these papers form a unified investigation into intelligence-driven transformation.
