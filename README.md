# AI Research — Modern Alchemy
### Spencer Kitaro Cottrell · San José State University

This repository presents a research program investigating artificial intelligence as a continuation of the historical tradition of **alchemy** — the study of transformation in matter, knowledge, and power.

Where classical alchemy sought the philosopher’s stone and the transmutation of materials, modern artificial intelligence raises parallel questions about the transformation of intelligence itself, the restructuring of economic systems, and the limits of human control over autonomous processes.

This work studies artificial intelligence as a transformational force shaping cognition, value creation, and institutional organization.

## Research Program — Modern Alchemy (2026)

This research examines artificial intelligence as a process of transformation across three domains:

1. **The Digital Philosopher’s Stone** — transformation of intelligence and emergence of autonomous agency  
2. **Economic Transmutation** — restructuring of value and production under machine intelligence  
3. **The Stone’s Shadow** — unintended consequences and limits of human governance  

Together these papers form a unified investigation into intelligence as a transformative force.

## Papers

### The Digital Philosopher’s Stone
A theoretical framework modeling intelligence scaling as a transformation process producing autonomous agency.

**Abstract**  
This paper examines artificial intelligence as a transformational process analogous to the alchemical search for the philosopher’s stone. It models intelligence scaling as a transition from tool-based systems toward autonomous agents and analyzes implications for control, coordination, and long-term system behavior.

### Economic Transmutation
Analysis of economic restructuring and value reallocation under advanced artificial intelligence.

**Abstract**  
This work studies how increasingly capable artificial intelligence systems restructure economic organization, production, and value creation. It analyzes how autonomous systems may transform traditional economic relationships and alter the distribution of decision-making power.

### The Stone’s Shadow
Failure modes and control challenges in increasingly autonomous systems.

**Abstract**  
This paper investigates the risks and unintended consequences arising from advanced autonomous systems. It examines limits of governance, alignment challenges, and structural constraints on maintaining human oversight over increasingly capable artificial intelligence.

## Research Roadmap

Future work includes:

- empirical modeling of autonomous agent behavior  
- economic simulation of AI-driven production systems  
- formal analysis of autonomy and control dynamics  
- governance and alignment frameworks for advanced intelligence
