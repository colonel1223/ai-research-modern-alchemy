**Current Release:** v0.1  
**Status:** Working Papers — Ongoing Research  

This repository presents a research program investigating artificial intelligence as a continuation of the historical tradition of **alchemy** — the study of transformation in matter, knowledge, and power.

Where classical alchemy sought the philosopher’s stone and the transmutation of materials, modern artificial intelligence raises parallel questions about the transformation of intelligence itself, the restructuring of economic systems, and the limits of human control over autonomous processes.

## Research Program — Modern Alchemy (2026)

This research examines artificial intelligence as a process of transformation across three domains:

1. **The Digital Philosopher’s Stone** — transformation of intelligence and emergence of autonomous agency  
2. **Economic Transmutation** — restructuring of value and production under machine intelligence  
3. **The Stone’s Shadow** — unintended consequences and limits of human governance
