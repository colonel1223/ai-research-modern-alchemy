## Overview

This repository presents a research program investigating artificial intelligence as a continuation of the historical tradition of alchemy — the study of transformation in matter, knowledge, and power.

Where classical alchemy sought the Philosopher’s Stone and the transmutation of elements, modern machine intelligence enables the transformation of cognition, economic structure, and human agency itself.

The work examines autonomous intelligence not as a technological trend, but as a structural force reshaping civilization.

The implications are treated directly and without abstraction: autonomy, loss of interpretability, redistribution of power, and the limits of human control over increasingly independent systems.

## Research Program — Modern Alchemy (2026)

The research is structured as a unified trilogy examining intelligence-driven transformation across three domains.

### I. Digital Philosopher’s Stone  
Transformation of intelligence and autonomous agency.  
Study of learning systems as self-improving entities.

### II. Economic Transmutation  
Restructuring of economic production and value under machine intelligence.  
Analysis of post-labor systems and algorithmic allocation.

→ Read: economic-transmutation-v0.1.pdf

---

### III. The Stone’s Shadow  
Failure modes, unintended consequences, and limits of governance.  
Control theory, alignment constraints, and systemic risk.

## Research Position

This work proceeds from several assumptions:

- Intelligence is undergoing structural transformation.
- Economic organization will reorganize around autonomous systems.
- Human interpretability and control may diminish.
- Artificial intelligence represents a civilizational transition.

The objective is not prediction, but rigorous examination of emerging reality.

## Status

Working papers — ongoing research program.

Future directions include:

- autonomous agent architectures  
- intelligence scaling theory  
- economic restructuring models  
- governance and alignment constraints  
- transformation of human decision systems
